The elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, which allows for fast access to individual elements. However, inserting or deleting elements in the middle of an array can be slow, as it requires shifting all subsequent elements.\n",

This structure allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements, as it does not require shifting elements in memory. However, accessing individual elements in a linked list can be slower than in an array, as it requires traversing the list from the beginning.\n",
