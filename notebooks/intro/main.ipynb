    "At MIT, in 1977, [Ron **R**ivest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Rivest), [Adi **S**hamir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shamir), and [Leonard **A**dleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Adleman) introduced the [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) cryptosystem. Today, their encryption algorithm sees wide-ranging applications; securing emails, network traffic in VPNs, and even your bank account transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given its uses in such sensitive domains, one would think that RSA is unbreakable; perhaps its inner workings are kept secret so no one can find out its vulnerabilites, or maybe it's just too complex for anyone to understand. Surprisingly, RSA's implementation is neither secret nor complex, and the algorithm that breaks it has been known since the day it was introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, we can write that algorithm ourselves. At the heart of RSA is a known number, $r$, that has two unknown prime factors, $p$ and $q$. All we need to decrypt an RSA-encrypted ciphertext is to find $p$ and $q$."
